[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/cayasso/engine.io-rooms.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/cayasso/engine.io-rooms)
[![NPM version](https://badge.fury.io/js/engine.io-rooms.png)](http://badge.fury.io/js/engine.io-rooms)

Low level Node.JS module that adds room capabilities to an Engine.IO server.

## Instalation

```
npm install engine.io-rooms
```

## Usage

### On the Server

```
var rooms = require('engine.io-rooms');
var engine = require('engine.io');
var server = require('http').createServer();
var io = engine(server);

// add rooms to eio
io = rooms(io);

io.on('connection', function (socket) {

  // joining room1 & room2
  socket.join('room1');
  socket.join('room2');
  socket.join('room3');

  // leaving room room2
  socket.leave('room2');

  // get rooms I am connected to
  var myRooms = socket.rooms();
  console.log(myRooms); // ['room1', 'room3']

  // send data to room1
  socket.room('room1');

  // send data to room1 & room3
  socket.room('room1 room3');

  // get clients connected to room1
  socket.room('room1').clients(function(clients) {
    console.log(clients); // output array of socket ids
  });

  // leaving all rooms
  socket.leaveAll();

  // join rooms on request
  socket.on('message', function(room) {
    socket.join(room);
  });

});

server.listen(8080);
```

### On the Client

```
var socket = eio('ws://localhost');
socket.onopen = function(){

  // Join the news room
  socket.send('news');
};

```
